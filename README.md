# Secure_Password_Manager

Explanation :
Using the same password for multiple email, shopping and social networking websites is risky, 
it means that a security breach at one website will compromise all your accounts, possibly even leading to identity theft.

So, the idea is that you memorise just one, reasonably long, secure main password and use that to generate a set of non-dictionary passwords. 
Copy and paste the new password(s) into the website and set your web browser to remember them

Notes: 
1) You can Download the file and use it offline no Internet connection required.
2) Idea is that you memorise just one, reasonably long, secure main password
3) All the websites get different passwords, but you only have to remember one!
4) Using a different PC? you can re-generate the same set of passwords at any time by returning to this page and entering the same main password.
5) For any website that's not on the list, just type the name into the 'Custom' box (the last one in the list) and press Generate or you can edit the code and add your own. 
6) Not all websites will accept 20 character passwords yet, but support is improving all the time.
7) Using UPPER or lower case will produce different passwords
8) when using this for the first time it’s a good idea to use the 'Show Password' tickbox to check for any typos.
9) Most websites will send a password reset via email, so set the password for that email account to something completely different, just in case you ever forget the main password!
10) This password generator works using Javascript, entirely within the page,
11) no data is ever passed back to my server. Notwithstanding this, it is a very good idea to save your own copy of this page
12) Keeping your own copy ensures that the password generator will still be available to you even if this website goes off-line
13) You can also View-Source and see exactly how the javascript works
14) copy it to a USB stick, email it to yourself, even upload it to your own website (it’s open source.)
15) There are no dependent files, just save as a single HTML file.
