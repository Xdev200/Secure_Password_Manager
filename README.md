# Secure_Password_Manager

Explanation
Using the same password for multiple email, shopping and social networking websites is risky, it means that a security breach at one website will compromise all your accounts, possibly even leading to identity theft.

So, the idea is that you memorise just one, reasonably long, secure main password and use that to generate a set of non-dictionary passwords. Copy and paste the new password(s) into the website and set your web browser to remember them.

All the websites get different passwords, but you only have to remember one!

Using a different PC? you can re-generate the same set of passwords at any time by returning to this page and entering the same main password.

For any website that's not on the list, just type the name into the 'Custom' box (the last one in the list) and press Generate.
This is the 20 character version, see also the 15 character version.
Not all websites will accept 20 character passwords yet, but support is improving all the time.
Using UPPER or lower case will produce different passwords, when using this for the first time it’s a good idea to use the 'Show Password' tickbox to check for any typos.
Most websites will send a password reset via email, so set the password for that email account to something completely different, just in case you ever forget the main password!
To navigate this page using the keyboard, use the TAB and RETURN keys.
If you are using Firefox with a password generator, you may wish to turn off the Firefox option to Suggest and Generate strong passwords. The Firefox password solution is rather limited because it will only work inside Firefox.
This password generator works using Javascript, entirely within the page, no data is ever passed back to my server. Notwithstanding this, it is a very good idea to save your own copy of this page. Zip file here. Keeping your own copy ensures that the password generator will still be available to you even if this website goes off-line. You can also View-Source and see exactly how the javascript works, copy it to a USB stick, email it to yourself, even upload it to your own website (it’s open source.) There are no dependent files, just save as a single HTML file.
